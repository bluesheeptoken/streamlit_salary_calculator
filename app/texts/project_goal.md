# Sample project using Streamlit 0.48.0

This sample project helps discovering Streamlit for :

 - Exploratory data analysis.
 - Simple model exposure.

In this project you will find several tabs :

 - Home: Explaining the purpose of the project.
 - EDA: Some basic Exploratory Data Analysis.
 - Prediction: Expose the model trained to users.

Be aware the model is absolutely not good, you will find super wrong predictions. The idea is just to test the speed of development for EDA and model exposure.
