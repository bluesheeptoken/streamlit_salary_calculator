# Feedback Streamlit 0.48.0

## EDA

I found the widgets to be super useful to expose data quite fast with just a little bit of code. The time when you need to rerun several times the same cells with different filters is now over thanks to the widgts.

## Model exposure

For this step, I serialized a model trained offline and read them from streamlit app.

This kind of exposure can be useful for a presentation, such as the ends of sprints. And I do think at this cheap cost, I will use it again in the future.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I do think streamlit has the potential to expose results from a data science team as a cheap cost while maintaining an easy and reproducible code organizationfor industrialization.
